# Data Analyst Technical Challenge
*Scenario project*:  Scenario: Analysing Medical Claims Data for Cost Reduction Opportunities
Dataset: With a historical medical claims dataset for a health
insurance company. This dataset included anonymised information on individual
members, their diagnoses, procedures performed, medications prescribed, and
the associated costs for each claim.

## Data Features:
Member Demographics: Age, gender, geographic location, Health Facility,
Claims Data: Diagnosis codes (ICD-10), procedure codes (CPT), medication codes
(NDC), dates of service, billed amount, verified amount, and paid amounts

## Problem Statement:
In many conversational AI systems, understanding context and delivering accurate, relevant responses remain significant challengesâ€”especially when dealing with narrative content. This project aims to develop a Deep Learning-based chatbot using Python that can read and comprehend a given story, and then engage in a Question-and-Answer (Q&A) dialogue based on that story. The chatbot will determine whether the user's questions are relevant and factually correct in the context of the story. The goal is to explore the application of natural language understanding (NLU) in creating intelligent systems capable of contextual reasoning and accurate response generation within narrative-based conversations.
