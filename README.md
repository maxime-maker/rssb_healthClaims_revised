# Data Analyst Technical Challenge
*Scenario project*:  Scenario: Analysing Medical Claims Data for Cost Reduction Opportunities
Dataset: With a historical medical claims dataset for a health
insurance company. This dataset included anonymised information on individual
members, their diagnoses, procedures performed, medications prescribed, and
the associated costs for each claim.

## Data Features:
Member Demographics: Age, gender, geographic location, Health Facility,
Claims Data: Diagnosis codes (ICD-10), procedure codes (CPT), medication codes
(NDC), dates of service, billed amount, verified amount, and paid amounts

## Requirement
The health insurance company is looking to identify areas for cost reduction
within its member population. Your task is to analyse the claims data and present
insights that can help the company achieve this goal using a tool of your choice.
Here are some guiding questions to consider during your analysis (do not be
limited to these):
1. Are they specific diagnoses or procedures that are driving a high proportion of
healthcare costs?
2. Are there any variations in costs based on member demographics, plan type,
or geographic location?
3. Can you identify any potential areas for cost savings through negotiations with
healthcare providers or by implementing disease management programs?
